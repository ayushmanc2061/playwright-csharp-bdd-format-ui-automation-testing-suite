## Overview

This repository contains an automation test suite crafted in Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) style using Playwright with C# and XUnit as the testing framework. It aims to provide a robust solution for automated UI testing, ensuring high quality and reliability in web applications.

## Features

- **Behavior Driven Development**: Write tests in a clear, human-readable format using Gherkin language.
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Run tests across different browsers to ensure compatibility.
- **Parallel Execution**: Speed up test runs by executing tests in parallel.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Get comprehensive reports for every test run, making it easy to track progress.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Easily integrate with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Well-documented code and examples for easy onboarding.

## Getting Started

To get started with this automation test suite, follow the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section. Ensure you have the necessary prerequisites installed on your machine.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ayushmanc2061/playwright-csharp-bdd-format-ui-automation-testing-suite.git
   cd playwright-csharp-bdd-format-ui-automation-testing-suite
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/ayushmanc2061/playwright-csharp-bdd-format-ui-automation-testing-suite/releases) section to download the latest version of the suite. Execute the necessary files to set up your environment.

## Usage

After installation, you can start writing your BDD tests. The suite is designed to be intuitive, allowing you to focus on writing tests without getting bogged down by configuration.

### Writing Tests

Tests are written in Gherkin language, which makes them readable for non-technical stakeholders. Here’s a simple example:

```gherkin
Feature: User Login

  Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
    Given the user is on the login page
    When the user enters valid credentials
    Then the user should be redirected to the dashboard
```

### Running Tests

To run your tests, use the following command:

```bash
dotnet test
```

This command will execute all tests in the project and provide a summary of the results.
